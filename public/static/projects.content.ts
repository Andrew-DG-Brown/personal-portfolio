    "insightful-analytics": "<p>This project was initially developed as a result of an interview assignment. I was given to me was a large dataset of consumer product data in .csv format from an e-commerce analytics start-up based in the UK. I designed and developed Insightful Analytics from the ground up based upon the this extensive dataset. The end product is a flexible dashboard giving actionable business insights. </p>\n<p>The design and development of Insightful Analytics included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relational SQL schema design</li>\n<li>Postgres database instance management/hosting with <a href=\"https://supabase.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Supabase</a></li>\n<li>Backend API architecture design and development with <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a> and <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Express</a></li>\n<li>Query performance optimization with <a href=\"https://orm.drizzle.team/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drizzle ORM</a></li>\n<li>Frontend UI design and development with <a href=\"https://react.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">React</a>/<a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nextjs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"uimockup\">UI Mockup</h3>\n<p>First, I visually conceptualized what metrics the dashboard could show based on the data. This included some overall metrics along with navigation panes showing a line chart, bar chart, and detailed table:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/projects/insightful-mockup.jpg\" alt=\"mockup\" /></p>\n<p>This original mockup allowed me to understand how the application would use the data in it's target state. </p>\n<h3 id=\"designingtheschema\">Designing the schema</h3>\n<p>I then began designing the SQL schema based on the original dataset. The relations where generally static with the exception of the time based data. For this I constructed the schema around the product_info table:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/projects/insightful-schema.jpg\" alt=\"schema-design\" /></p>\n<p>This schema diagram was the final design iteration. Changes were made throughout the design to achieve the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple table indexes for efficient joins on selects</li>\n<li>Relational tables only for highly unique column values</li>\n<li>product table separation as multiple retailers sell the same product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"apiuiintegration\">API/UI integration</h3>\n<p>Once the database was designed and deployed, the final step was setting up the API and frontend. For the backend server, I went with a straight forward <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a>/<a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Express</a> REST API. The server returned structured JSON payloads for each section of the UI, which included dynamically built configs for the select inputs.</p>\n<p>Here is a short video demo of Insightful Analytics in action:</p>\n<video autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src=\"/videos/projects/insightful-demo.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>"
