DEFA was my first full web design and web application project. I combined my design experience with my knowledge of the foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Utilizing the [Coin Gecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) public API, I built DEFA's sleek UI along with the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library to display data in line charts.

Here is a short video demo of the application in action:
