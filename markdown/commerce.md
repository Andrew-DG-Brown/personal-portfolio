This project was inspired by a [React](https://react.dev/) course for the global state management library [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). I took the initial project and made it my own by adding production level e-commerce features such as:

- Products stored and configured with [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- Utilizing [Redux's](https://redux.js.org/) global store for site wide text search
- Category based routing with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
